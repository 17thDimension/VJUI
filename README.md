*VJUI* is a set of custom UI controls that are specially designed for VJing.

It contains three custom controls:

**Knob** allows the user to select a numeric value by dragging the mouse.
This is similar to the Slider control but easier to control on a
touch-sensitive screen.

**Button** is almost identical to the standard Button control, but it also
provides the `OnButtonDown` event not only the `OnButtonUp` event. This is
convenient for VJing because `OnButtonDown` is often used more than
`OnButtonUp`.

**Toggle** is a variant of the standard Toggle control. It's customized to
use the same style to Knob and Button.
